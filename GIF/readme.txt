this golang script outputs a singular Lissajous figures, in other words we are making a gif really (image also). 
try to open in image viewer, if it shows "isnt supporting" then try mozilla firefox. In case mozilla also doest work try opening 
in photoshop(windows) or GNU image manipulation Program(debian,linux).

in case, if wanna build then do :: 
1. go build <go_script_name> 
2. ./<go_script_name> > <something.gif>
3. then open <something.gif>

note::angle braces are for syntax representation do not include those in file name.
